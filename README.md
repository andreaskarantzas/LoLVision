LoLVision is a Mac application that will be distributed through the Mac App Store. It enables the user to see the statistics of the players in a current game such as : Ranked wins/losses, spells, League points, Division, Playstyle and if the player is in a Hot Streak.
Additionally the player can also check the current rotation of free champions. It uses the Riot API to receive the data required and does not store any user information.
The application in the help section of the menu bar will contain instructions of what the user can do with the application and how.
